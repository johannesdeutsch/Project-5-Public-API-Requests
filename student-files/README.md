# Project 5 Public API Requests
 Treehouse Techdegree Project 5

This project is about a fictional company called Aweseome Startup. They need a way to share the contact data of their remote employees. The solution is the following: a request is sent to an API to get 12 different employee data and display them on the page. If a user clicks on one of the cards that show those employees, a modal window is opened. On the modal window itself are buttons to close it and to toggle between the employees back and forth. On top of the page there's a search bar, to be able to filter the employee by their names.


CSS Style Changes: 
I changed the background color of the body from rgba(235, 235, 235, 0.9) to a light yellow with rgba(250, 245, 226, 0.9) and changed the font to Palatino.
